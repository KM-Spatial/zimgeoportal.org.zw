        <h2>We're now in the Stagging & Testing Phase</h2>
        <small>07 September 2025</small>
        <p>Dear Stakeholder, since our last update, we're happy to inform you that we are currently in the process of testing out our latest 
            and newly developed Zimbabwe Geoportal. 
        </p>
        <p>We appreciate your thoughts, suggestions and comments on this newly developed platform. Ready to test it out? </p>

        <h2>Notification on Zimbabwe Geoportal Service Interruption</h2>
        <p>
            As of May 15, 2025, the Zimbabwe Geoportal was taken offline following a notice from Microsoft Azure Services concerning a potential violation of privacy terms. We understand the value and importance this platform holds for researchers, government institutions, students, developers, and citizens who rely on it for open, accessible geospatial data about Zimbabwe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the incident, our team has been working diligently with Microsoft Azure to fully understand and address the concerns raised. After thorough engagement and assessment, we have made the decision to rebuild the Zimbabwe Geoportal from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
            This marks a new chapter in our commitment to delivering a more secure, reliable, and future-proof national platform for geospatial data. The rebuild process is already underway, and we are prioritizing transparency, user trust, and data integrity in every step.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recognize the disruption this may have caused and sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding. The Zimbabwe Geoportal remains the only public-facing, open-access platform dedicated to geospatial data in the country—and we are working tirelessly to bring it back, better than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further updates, timelines, and opportunities for user feedback will be communicated on this website and through our official communication channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for standing with us.
        </p>
